Luciano's 20-year old son Leo (Giuseppe Fumo) has little respect for his father's simple ways and instead idealizes his two Mafioso uncles and their urban lifestyle. When Leo shoots up a local bar owned by a rival family, his reckless actions reignites a longstanding blood feud and sets off a tragic chain of events that violently grinds toward an inevitable bloody showdown for all involved.(C) Vitagraph", "critic_score": -1, "trailer_youtube_id": "D5gUDIIe67Y"}, ];
